2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net one/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin one/bcd_digit[3]_i_2__0/O, cell one/bcd_digit[3]_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net two/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin two/bcd_digit[3]_i_2__1/O, cell two/bcd_digit[3]_i_2__1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net twobit_counter/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin twobit_counter/segs_reg[6]_i_2/O, cell twobit_counter/segs_reg[6]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net zero/bcd_digit_reg[2]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin zero/bcd_digit[3]_i_2/O, cell zero/bcd_digit[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT one/bcd_digit[3]_i_2__0 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
two/bcd_digit_reg[0], two/bcd_digit_reg[1], two/bcd_digit_reg[2]
two/bcd_digit_reg[3]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT two/bcd_digit[3]_i_2__1 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
three/bcd_digit_reg[0], three/bcd_digit_reg[1], three/bcd_digit_reg[2]
three/bcd_digit_reg[3]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT zero/bcd_digit[3]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
one/bcd_digit_reg[0], one/bcd_digit_reg[1], one/bcd_digit_reg[2]
one/bcd_digit_reg[3]
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
